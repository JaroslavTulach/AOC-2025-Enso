# Enso Advent of Code 2025

[![CI](https://github.com/JaroslavTulach/AOC-2025-Enso/actions/workflows/enso.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JaroslavTulach/AOC-2025-Enso/actions/workflows/enso.yml)

Get ready for [AoC 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) by
solving its tasks for  in [Enso](http://enso.org).

## Fork Your Own Copy

First of all fork [this repository](https://github.com/JaroslavTulach/AOC-2025-Enso.git)
to your github account. 

## Setup & Execution

Get this repository to your local computer. Use `git` to clone it:
```bash
$ git checkout https://github.com/JaroslavTulach/AOC-2025-Enso.git
$ cd AOC-2025-Enso
$ ls -1
Dec00
README.md
```
Let's download [Enso](http://enso.org) now. Enso can run on Linux, Windows, MacOSX. 
The following is tested on [2025.2.4](https://github.com/enso-org/enso/releases/tag/2025.2.4) version.

Add the `AOC-2025-Enso` folder into your IDE. Then you'll see the skeletal
`Dec00` project. You can open the project and play with it, but 
before you start solving real [AoC 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) tasks,
it is **suggested to duplicate** the project...

<img width="918" height="639" alt="Duplicate & Rename" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aa72b7b-52e2-4f96-a6bf-a852d5719062" />

and **rename it** for example to `Dec01` for the first task of the [AoC 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## Continuous Integration Check

The github repository contains [automatic CI check](./.github/workflows/enso.yml)
to verify your changes to the repository are correct.
